# Verilog Testbench Generator
Custom verilog test-bench skeleton generator written in C++ to make our lives simpler.

### Why?
Student usually start their verilog journey with Xilinx ISE or Vivado ISE, and these ide/tools have the options of generating testbenches and creating modules using graphical tools. Unfortunately, for student shifting to iVerilog and other open-source tools, these options don't esixt. So to make it a little easier for the students, this program was created.

### Isn't learning syntax for TB better? 
Yes it is. But then again, this is FOR BEGINNERS. To start at the shallow end.
